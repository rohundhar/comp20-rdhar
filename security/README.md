This is a security evalation of a server for an all called MapChat. I was asked to identify specific security and privacy issues within this server, and report on my findings. This process took me approximately three hours to complete, and I used a variety of methods for my testing, including : Postman and curl (terminal). 

After administering this test, I realized how often a simple oversight can lead to damaging Cross-Site Scripting and invasion of user's privacy. Security is an ever-important part of any software development; The question "does it work?" should be treated with the same importance as "as it safe?".
