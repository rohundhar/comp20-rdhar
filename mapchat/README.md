Assignment 2


In this assignment, we were asked to use the Google Maps API as well as the HTML5 geolocation API in tandem with XMLHttpRequest in order to create a pseudo-google maps application that receives and displays location information from a server!

This assigment took approximately three hours to complete, and I did not collaborate with any other students. I took a lot of inspiration from an example that our instructor, Ming Chow, wrote for how to use the Google Maps APi properly.
