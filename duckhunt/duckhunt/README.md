In this assignment, I used the "canvas" HTML5 tag to draw a basic frame from the video game 'duckhunt'. I used this method to draw the background image as well as the two birds. I was unable to animate the birds properly, but the drawn images load and display properly. I didn't collaborate with any other students, and it took me about two hours to complete,
