In this assignment, I implemented a simple responsive design tactic in which the image displayed on the webpage changes depending on the web browser's width. These images were condensed into a single spritesheet, which is much faster to load and work with than several different images.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment, and it took me approximately one hour in total to complete.
