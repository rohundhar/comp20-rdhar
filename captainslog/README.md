This is a readme file for the captainslog lab. In this lab, we were asked to use Jquery in order to manipulate local storage for the purpose of saving and displaying messages with a specific time stamp. 

For this assignment, I chose to save the messages, in string format, in a single array that represented the value of a key called "messages". I would access that key, print its existing values, and then append new messages before updating the localstorage unit again.

I spent approximately 4 hours on this project, much of that time actually finding an efficient way to hold all of the messages in local storage with easy access.

I collaborated with Eric Snyder on this assignment with regards to the above stated algorithm.
